# Deccription
The proposed framework addresses the scarcity of training data to build supervised learning models for mineral mapping on Martian surface using CRISM hyperspectral imagery, by augmenting the spectra from MICA library, following a processing pipeline, and finally extracting the key absorption features for training. A trained model labels the spectra in a test CRISM image processed through the same pipeline.
